# TouchBox - Use your Xbox controller as a keyboard

## Building
Open TouchBox.sln in Visual Studio, and build from there

## Usage
Start the program to use the XBox controller as a keyboard.

The program maintains a state with the current keyboard layout and two virtual fingers (one left and one right). Assuming a standard English US QWERTY layout, the left finger starts above D and the right finger starts above K. The thumbsticks will move the virtual fingers.

* Left shoulder button = Left shift
* Right shoulder button = Right shift
* Left trigger = Press button under the left virtual finger
* Right trigger = Press button under the right virtual finger
